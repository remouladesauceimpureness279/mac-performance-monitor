/// Runs the one-shot `nettop -P -x -J bytes_in,bytes_out -L 1` on its **own
/// background queue — never on the sampler's hot path**. `nettop` can take several
/// seconds to produce a sample on some machines (≈20 ms on others); running it
/// synchronously inside the per-process scan dragged the entire sampler (menu bar
/// included) down to nettop's speed. Instead a background loop runs it, differences
/// consecutive cumulative snapshots into per-PID byte rates over the *actual*
/// elapsed interval, and caches them. The sampler reads the cache non-blocking via
/// `latestRates()`, so a slow nettop only makes the per-app network figures
/// refresh less often — it no longer throttles sampling.
///
/// `start()` launches the loop; `stop()` halts it. A hard timeout guards against a
/// wedged nettop, and adaptive pacing (`paceSleep`) keeps it from spinning on fast
/// machines *and* from respawning back-to-back on machines where one run takes
/// longer than the fixed floor.
/// `CPUMath.delta` clamps the occasional counter decrease (a flow closing, or a
