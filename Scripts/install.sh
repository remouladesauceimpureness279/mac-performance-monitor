# install.sh — the one release step: build, sign, notarize, staple, install to
# /Applications, and launch.
#
# Signing is Developer ID Application ONLY — hardened runtime, secure timestamp,
# and the app entitlements. There is deliberately NO ad-hoc or Apple-Development
# path, so a build can never leave here signed in a way the notary (or another
# Mac's Gatekeeper) would reject. The app is then notarized and stapled, so what
# lands in /Applications is release-ready. The privileged helper signs with the
# same Developer ID, which also keeps its SMAppService registration stable.
#
# Notarization uses a notarytool keychain profile (set up ONCE):
#   xcrun notarytool store-credentials macperfmon-notary \
#     --key /path/AuthKey_XXXXXX.p8 --key-id <KEY_ID> --issuer <ISSUER_UUID>
#   # ...or with an Apple ID + app-specific password:
#   xcrun notarytool store-credentials macperfmon-notary \
#     --apple-id you@example.com --team-id <TEAMID> --password <app-specific-pw>
# Override the profile name with the NOTARY_PROFILE environment variable.
#
# This is an Apple Silicon (arm64) only project; builds are never universal.
#
# Flags:
#   --no-launch      install but do not launch afterwards
#   --skip-notarize  sign + install + launch only (still Developer ID signed; for
#                    fast local iteration — NOT for anything you distribute)
