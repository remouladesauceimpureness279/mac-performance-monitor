# publishChecks.sh — sign the diagnostic check catalog and publish it to the server.
#
# The catalog (checks/manifest.json) is the declarative rule set clients download to
# run the deep-dive diagnostics. This signs it with the LOCAL Ed25519 private key
# (catalog-signing.pem — kept off the server, gitignored) and uploads the manifest
# plus its detached signature. Clients verify the signature with the public key
# embedded in the app, so a compromised server or CDN cannot forge or alter rules.
#
# Usage:
#   Scripts/publishChecks.sh --seed     # (re)create checks/manifest.json from the
#                                        # in-app built-in pack, then sign + upload
#   Scripts/publishChecks.sh            # sign + upload the current checks/manifest.json
#
# To ship a change: edit checks/manifest.json (add/tune rules AND bump "version"
# above the app's built-in version, currently 1), then run this. Clients adopt a
# downloaded manifest only when its signature is valid AND its version is newer.
