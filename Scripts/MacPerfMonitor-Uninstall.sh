# Mac Performance Monitor — Full uninstaller
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Double-click to run (see note below if macOS blocks it the first time).
#
# This COMPLETELY REMOVES Mac Performance Monitor and gives you a clean slate:
#   • Quits the app and its auto-updater, then force-kills any leftover processes.
#   • Stops and unregisters the privileged helper (the demand-launched
#     SMAppService LaunchDaemon "uk.co.bzwrd.macperfmonitor.helper").
#   • Deletes EVERY copy of the app bundle it can find (this is what stops the
#     "multiple copies keep relaunching" problem — duplicate/registered copies).
#   • Removes the app's data, caches, preferences and saved state.
#   • Removes the stored licence from the Keychain.
#
# It only ever touches files that belong to THIS app (matched by name, bundle id
# "uk.co.bzwrd.macperfmonitor", or helper label). It does not touch anything else.
#
# It asks you to confirm before deleting, and needs your admin password once to
# remove the privileged helper.
#
# It writes a log to your Desktop. Please email that file back to us.
#
# If double-clicking shows "unidentified developer" / "cannot be opened":
#   right-click the file → Open → Open. (Downloaded scripts are blocked by default.)
# Or in Terminal:  chmod +x "<this file>"  then run it.
